  **Design Movement**: Nordic Modernism meets Nature Immersion
  
  **Core Principles**:
  1. **Biophilic Connection**: Seamlessly blend the digital interface with the physical beauty of the Swedish landscape.
  2. **Serene Functionality**: Interactions should feel calm, purposeful, and effortless, mirroring a relaxing getaway.
  3. **Authentic Storytelling**: Let the images and the owner's voice lead the narrative, creating a personal connection.
  4. **Seasonal Adaptability**: Design elements that feel appropriate for both summer lake activities and winter cozy retreats.

  **Color Philosophy**:
  - **Primary**: Deep Forest Green (#1B5E3F) - Represents the surrounding woodlands and stability.
  - **Background**: Crisp White (#FFFFFF) - Provides a clean canvas, like fresh snow or a bright summer day, ensuring readability and focus on imagery.
  - **Accents**: 
    - Lake Blue (#4A90E2) - For water-related elements and calm calls-to-action.
    - Sun Yellow (#F5A623) - For warmth, highlights, and energy (summer activities).
    - Eventika Magenta (#E91E63) - Used sparingly for high-impact moments (booking buttons, special offers) to tie in the brand identity.
  - **Reasoning**: This palette directly reflects the environment (forest, lake, sun) while respecting the existing brand identity. It creates a fresh, inviting, and professional atmosphere.

  **Layout Paradigm**:
  - **Asymmetric & Organic**: Move away from rigid block grids. Use overlapping elements and organic shapes to mimic nature.
  - **Full-Width Immersion**: Utilize full-width hero sections and image bands to showcase the stunning photography.
  - **Sectional Flow**: Create a narrative flow down the page, guiding the user from introduction to exploration to action (booking).

  **Signature Elements**:
  - **Curved Dividers**: Soft, wave-like section dividers to evoke the lake and rolling hills.
  - **Translucent Overlays**: Glassmorphism effects on cards and navigation to maintain context of the background imagery.
  - **Iconography**: Custom, thin-line icons representing nature and activities (pine tree, wave, cabin, cutlery).

  **Interaction Philosophy**:
  - **Hover-Reveal**: Images in carousels expand or reveal details on hover, encouraging exploration.
  - **Smooth Scroll**: Gentle parallax effects on background images to create depth.
  - **Sticky Navigation**: A clean, unobtrusive sticky header that ensures booking is always accessible.

  **Animation**:
  - **Entrance**: Elements fade and slide up gently as the user scrolls (fade-in-up).
  - **Hover**: Subtle scaling (1.05x) and shadow deepening on interactive cards.
  - **Carousel**: Smooth, continuous gliding motion for image showcases.

  **Typography System**:
  - **Headings**: *Playfair Display* (Serif) - Elegant, classic, and welcoming. Adds a touch of boutique luxury.
  - **Body**: *Lato* or *Montserrat* (Sans-serif) - Clean, modern, and highly legible for information and descriptions.
  - **Hierarchy**: Large, expressive headings paired with readable, well-spaced body text.

  **Design Movement**: Rustic Industrial Chic
  
  **Core Principles**:
  1. **Raw & Refined**: Contrast rough textures (wood, stone) with sleek modern elements.
  2. **Event-Centric**: Focus on the energy and excitement of gatherings and celebrations.
  3. **Bold Typography**: Use type as a primary visual element to convey confidence and scale.
  4. **Dynamic Grid**: A masonry-style layout that feels spontaneous and lively.

  **Color Philosophy**:
  - **Primary**: Charcoal / Dark Slate - For a sophisticated, premium event feel.
  - **Background**: Off-White / Cream - Softer than pure white, adding warmth.
  - **Accents**: 
    - Forest Green - As a grounding natural element.
    - Magenta - Used boldly for energy and excitement.
    - Gold/Brass - For a touch of luxury in details.
  - **Reasoning**: This approach positions Eventika as a premium venue for memorable events, moving slightly away from just "nature retreat" to "exclusive destination."

  **Layout Paradigm**:
  - **Masonry Grids**: Dynamic image galleries that look like a curated collection of memories.
  - **Split Screen**: Vertical split layouts for text/image pairings to keep content digestible.
  - **Card-Based**: Distinct content cards for services and packages.

  **Signature Elements**:
  - **Texture Overlays**: Subtle grain or paper textures on backgrounds.
  - **Bold Borders**: Thick, defined borders on buttons and images.
  - **Geometric Shapes**: Sharp angles and lines to contrast with organic photos.

  **Interaction Philosophy**:
  - **Snap Scroll**: Sections snap into place for a presentation-like feel.
  - **Click-Expand**: Cards expand to fill the screen with details.

  **Animation**:
  - **Staggered Load**: Grid items load one by one for a cascading effect.
  - **Text Reveal**: Headlines slide out from behind masks.

  **Typography System**:
  - **Headings**: *Oswald* or *Bebas Neue* (Condensed Sans) - Tall, bold, and impactful.
  - **Body**: *Roboto Slab* (Serif) - Approachable and sturdy.

  **Design Movement**: Minimalist Scandinavian Zen
  
  **Core Principles**:
  1. **Less is More**: Extreme simplicity to let the mind rest and the photos speak.
  2. **Airy & Light**: Maximum whitespace to create a feeling of spaciousness.
  3. **Function First**: Every element has a clear purpose; no decoration for decoration's sake.
  4. **Softness**: Rounded corners, soft shadows, and gentle colors.

  **Color Philosophy**:
  - **Primary**: Sage Green - A softer, more muted version of the forest green.
  - **Background**: Pure White.
  - **Accents**: 
    - Slate Blue - Muted and calming.
    - Pale Wood - Warm beige tones.
  - **Reasoning**: Focuses entirely on the relaxation and wellness aspect (Spa, Nature).

  **Layout Paradigm**:
  - **Single Column**: A focused, linear narrative flow.
  - **Centralized Content**: Text and images centered with wide margins.

  **Signature Elements**:
  - **Circle Masks**: Images cropped into circles or soft ovals.
  - **Thin Lines**: Hairline dividers and borders.

  **Interaction Philosophy**:
  - **Minimal Feedback**: Subtle color shifts on hover.
  - **Fade Transitions**: Page transitions are slow and dissolving.

  **Animation**:
  - **Slow Fade**: Elements slowly appear from 0 to 100 opacity.

  **Typography System**:
  - **Headings**: *Quicksand* (Rounded Sans) - Friendly and soft.
  - **Body**: *Open Sans* - Neutral and legible.
